Build a web-based CRM + campaign tool for University Center Managers that helps them target students for events based on inferred interests from student data.

Goal:
Help centers recruit the right students into events/programs by automatically understanding each student’s interests using:
- Resume text (skills, industries, keywords, past roles)
- Club join history (club categories, leadership roles, participation)
- Class enrollment history (course titles, department, concentration)
The system should generate an “Interest Profile” per student (e.g., AI/ML, consulting, entrepreneurship, fintech, healthcare, sustainability) with confidence scores.

Product Scope (focus ONLY on students + events/campaigns; no mentor features).

UI Style:
Modern SaaS like Notion + Airtable + HubSpot campaign tools.
Clean, minimal, dashboard-first.
Include light + dark mode.

DATA MODEL / ENTITIES:
1) Student
- Name, email, program (MBA/undergrad/etc), grad year
- Resume (upload or pasted text)
- Clubs joined (list, roles, dates)
- Classes taken (list, term)
- Interest Profile (auto-generated tags + scores)
- Engagement history (messages received, opens, clicks, event sign-ups)

2) Event
- Name, date/time, capacity, description, category tags

3) Campaign (core object)
- Campaign name
- Linked event
- Targeting rules
- Timeline/schedule
- Target metrics (goal sign-ups)
- Content (message editor)
- Status (draft/scheduled/running/completed)

KEY FEATURES REQUIRED:

(1) Campaign Builder (Add Campaign)
A step-by-step flow with these sections:
A. Select Event
- choose an existing event or create a new event

B. Targeting (Interest-based targeting)
- Show recommended segments based on inferred Interest Profiles
- Filters: program, grad year, classes taken, clubs joined, interest tags, confidence threshold
- “Target size” control: user decides the number of students to target (Top N)
- Show a ranked preview list of students who match, sorted by relevance score

C. Timeline / Scheduling
- Set when to send the message (date + time)
- Option to schedule multiple waves (optional)
- Show a simple timeline view

D. Numbers / Goals
- Input: “How many students do you want to sign up?” (target sign-ups)
- System shows predicted conversion estimate based on historical performance (optional)
- Suggest recommended target size (optional)

E. Content Editor
- Rich text editor to craft the message
- Variables for personalization: {FirstName}, {InterestTag}, {RelevantClub}, {RelevantClass}
- CTA button linking to signup page
- AI assist (optional): rewrite, shorten, create variations, subject line suggestions

F. Review & Launch

- Confirm campaign creation

(2) Campaign Dashboard (Required)
A dashboard that shows per-campaign performance and overall performance.

For each campaign show:
- Reach: number of students targeted / messages sent
- Views: opens (or views)
- Clicks (optional)
- Conversions: sign-ups
- Conversion rate
- Progress toward goal sign-ups (e.g., 63/100)
- Current status: draft / scheduled / running / completed
- Timeline status: sent / upcoming send / completed

Dashboard views:
- Overall campaigns table with filters (by event, status, date range)
- Campaign detail page with funnel chart + time-series trend
- Segment breakdown: which interests/class/club segments converted best

PAGES TO GENERATE:
- Landing page (simple value prop for university centers)
- Main dashboard (overview metrics + campaigns list)
- Students page (table + student profile + inferred interest profile)
- Events page (events list + event detail)
- Create Campaign wizard (multi-step)
- Campaign dashboard + campaign detail analytics

IMPORTANT UX REQUIREMENTS:
- The tool should make it easy to “target the top N students” based on inferred interests
- Show clear, explainable reasons for why a student is targeted (e.g., “Matched: AI interest from resume + AI club + ML course”)
- The campaign dashboard must make it obvious whether the campaign is on track to hit the sign-up target

Keep the product focused, practical, and purpose-built for university center managers.
